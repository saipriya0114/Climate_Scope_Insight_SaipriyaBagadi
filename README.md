# Global Climate and Air Quality Analysis Dashboard

## **📌 Page 1: Global Climate and Air Quality Overview**

This page provides a high-level summary of worldwide climate metrics along with trend analysis. It helps users understand how temperature, humidity, wind, and air quality vary by month, year, and country.

### **🔹 Key Features**

### **1. KPI Cards (Summary Metrics)**

Four main indicators are shown:

* **Avg_temp °C** – Average temperature recorded.
* **Avg_humidity %** – Average humidity levels.
* **Avg_wind Kph** – Average wind speed.
* **Avg_airquality_PM2.5** – Average PM2.5 air pollution levels.

These give users an instant understanding of climate conditions.

### **2. Slicers for Filtering**

Users can filter the entire dashboard using:

* **Year (2023, 2024)**
* **Month**
* **Weather Conditions:** High Wind, Heavy Pollution, Extreme Heat

This allows the visuals to update dynamically for detailed analysis.

### **3. Temperature Trend by Month & Year**

A **line chart** that shows how temperature changes across months for both years. It helps identify:

* Seasonal variations
* Monthly spikes/dips
* Differences between 2023 and 2024

### **4. Country-wise Temperature & Humidity**

A **combined clustered column chart** that compares temperature and humidity for each country. It helps analyze:

* Which countries are hotter
* Regions with high humidity
* Climate patterns by geography

### **5. Average PM2.5 by Month (Donut Chart)**

A donut chart showing the contribution of each month to PM2.5 levels. This helps identify:

* Most polluted months
* Cleaner months
* Air quality patterns through the year

## **📌 Page 2: Country-Level Insights & Trends**

This page focuses more on **detailed insights**, **comparisons**, and **interpreted conclusions** based on the data.

### **🔹 Key Features**

### **1. KPI Cards With Explanations**

Each KPI from Page 1 is repeated with a short insight box:

* Temperature rising trend from 2023 to 2024
* Consistently high humidity patterns
* Stable wind speed variations

These insights summarize patterns derived from the dataset.

### **2. Top 5 Highest Temperature Countries**

A **horizontal bar chart** that shows the hottest countries:

* Sudan
* Thailand
* Indonesia
* Madagascar
* Vietnam

This helps quickly identify extreme temperature zones.

### **3. Air Quality Trend Over Months**

A **line chart** displaying PM2.5 levels from January to August. It reveals:

* PM2.5 decreasing trend across months
* The best and worst air quality periods
* Seasonal transitions in pollution

### **4. Same Filters as Page 1**

Provides continuity in navigation:

* Year, Month
* Weather condition filters

These filters make Page 1 and Page 2 fully connected for deeper exploration.
